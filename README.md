Investigating the Behavior of Researchers/Software Engineers/Programmers in Modularizing a Software System for Better Code Understanding

Dear Researchers/Software Engineers/Programmers,
We, at the Software Maintenance Laboratory of the University of Tabriz, are conducting a study to understand the behavior of Researchers/Software Engineers/Programmers in modularizing (foldering or clustering) software systems. Our goal is to develop criteria for automatic modularization that enhance code comprehension.
In this form, we present 11 different modules, each containing 7 artifacts. Some artifacts are interrelated within the same module, while others are connected to artifacts in different modules. As a researcher experienced in software modularization, we kindly request you evaluate the quality of these 11 clusters by assigning a number between 1 and 5. A higher number indicates a better cluster in terms of code understanding.
Definitions:
•	Software Understanding: This refers to the cognitive process in software development and maintenance where a developer comprehends and interprets the source code. Effective software understanding is crucial for making changes and ensuring the functionality of various parts of the code is clear. Modularization through foldering can aid in this process.
•	Artifact: Any software component such as a file, class, method, or function is referred to as an artifact.
•	Coupling: The degree of interdependence between folders (modules or clusters) is called coupling. Lower coupling is generally preferred as it indicates modules are more independent.
•	Cohesion: The degree to which elements within a folder (module or cluster) are related to each other is known as cohesion. Higher cohesion within a module is desirable as it signifies that the elements are well-integrated.
We appreciate your time and effort in contributing to this research. Your insights will be invaluable in developing automated tools that facilitate better software modularization for improved code understanding.
Instructions:
•	Please rate each of the 11 clusters based on your assessment of their quality, where 1 indicates minimum understanding and 5 indicates maximum understanding.
•	Consider the definitions provided when assigning your ratings.
Thank you for your participation.
Sincerely,
The Software Maintenance Laboratory
University of Tabriz
